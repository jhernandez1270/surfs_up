Cream shop in Hawaii. Using Python, Pandas and SQLAlchemy to present weather statisics
for certain months in the Hawaiian Islands to determine which island would be the best
location and to determine an ice cream shop sustainability year-round.

## Results

We designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and plotted the results.

The trend we can observe based on this plot is that some months have higher amounts of precipitation
than others. Those months being September, February and May.
